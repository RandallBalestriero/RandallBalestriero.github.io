                    Learning in High Dimension Always Amounts to Extrapolation

                    The notion of interpolation and extrapolation is fundamental in various fields from deep learning to
                    function approximation. Interpolation occurs for a sample x whenever this sample falls inside or on
                    the boundary of the given datasetâ€™s convex hull. Extrapolation occurs when x falls outside of that
                    convex hull. One fundamental (mis)conception is that state-of-the-art algorithms work so well
                    because of their ability to correctly interpolate training data. A second (mis)conception is that
                    interpolation happens throughout tasks and datasets, in fact, many intuitions and theories rely on
                    that assumption. We empirically and theoretically argue against those two points and demonstrate
                    that on any high-dimensional (>100) dataset, interpolation almost surely never happens. Those
                    results challenge the validity of our current interpolation/extrapolation definition as an indicator
                    of generalization performances.
